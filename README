AOTNSURLSessionDownloadOperation wraps a NSURLSessionDownloadTask managed by 
AFNetworking 2 in an NSOperation so it can be managed with a NSOperationQueue.
This allows you to queue any number of downloads and let the run serially
(in sequence, by setting operationQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 1) or in 
parallel (operationQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount > 1).

Make sure you have permission to write in the saveURL you provide.

COMPATIBILITY: iOS 7 and higher (due to availability of NSURLSession)
